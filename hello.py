# Basics of Python

# No need to declare a data type
my_name = "Naima"
print(my_name)

# Variables are case sensitive and use Snake case; Pascal case is used for classes
My_name = "Not Naima"
print(My_name)

# Can assign a variable with the value of another
name = "Jennifer"
jennifer = name
print(jennifer)

# Print multiple times
person = "John"
print(person * 5)

# Can use single or double quotes for strings
print('How\'s it going?')
print("How's it going?")

# Integers also don't need to be declared
numbers = 22
print(numbers)

# Int function can be used to parse to integers
number_in_string = '22'
print(int(number_in_string))
